STOP AND READ THIS.

To fix the "Sign in Loop" on Vercel, you must add this ONE secret key.

1. Go to your Vercel Dashboard for this project ("claude-workspace").
2. Click "Settings" (top menu).
3. Click "Environment Variables" (left menu).
4. Add a new variable:

   Key:   NEXTAUTH_SECRET
   Value: 9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08

5. Click "Save".
6. Go to "Deployments" and Redeploy (or push a small change to trigger it).

WITHOUT THIS, THE APP WILL NEVER WORK ON VERCEL.
